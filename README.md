# Howdy

## Overview

[Betty][0] wants to please [sempai][1] at a [laboratory][2], but needs 
[Harry][3] to do it. Betty is similar to [Mary][4] in that she has done 
all of her homework on Harry, but has never actually met him until the 
First-Date. Does she learn anything new about Harry? Like most Gettier-
style problems, we might label this a *Boy Next Door Problem*.

## Scopics

Weâ€™re going to plug JSON into our lab to tinker with love as Betty flirts with 
Harry on various First-Date Time Problems.
